        <h2>About Sunrise/Sunset #132</h2>
        <p>
            SUNRISE/SUNSET is one of the few places in the world you can watch the sun rise and set over the ocean right in front of your home. This stunning <strong>oceanfront 2-bedroom / 2-bath condo</strong> was completely renovated with attention to every detail. Step off the expansive wrap-around deck directly onto the sand, watch whales from bed, or walk 15 yards to the palapa pool and restaurant. This ground-floor unit truly has it all.
